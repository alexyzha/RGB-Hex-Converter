# How to download:
- "RGB-Hex Converter.app/Contents" is the compiled app. You can simply download the entire folder (\[<> Code] ––> "Download ZIP")
- Once you run it it'll appear in your menu bar. You can leave it open if you'd like.
- I would recommend putting the app in your applications folder/dock/launchpad if you're going to use it a lot :)
- Click the icon in the menu bar, and then "Quit" at the bottom of the popover menu to quit.

**The download button:**

# RGB-Hex Converter:
This is an app that sits in the macOS menubar. It takes any valid RGB string input and returns a hexadecimal string "#XXYYZZ". Hexadecimal strings, if valid, will return "\[num], \[num], \[num]".

**Here's the format for valid strings:**
- For Hex: "#XXYYZZ".
- For RGB: "\[num](any number of ' ' or ',')\[num](any number of ' ' or ',')\[num]".
- XX, YY, and ZZ are all hexadecimals from 00 to FF.
- \[num] can be any number from 0-255.

# Better Clipboard:

This app also lets you **store up to 5 colors** (Hex), as shown below:

**This is how you use it:**
- **\[Click]** the "Copy #XXYYZZ" to copy to clipboard.
- While hovering over any slot, **Command + \[Click]** to paste valid RGB string or Hex from clipboard to the chosen slot.

# As of 2/4/2024 (Bugs?):
- On my own computer there's an issue where you can only paste by right clicking on the input textfield and manually pressing paste.
